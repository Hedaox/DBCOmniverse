# Omni Kings - Custom Race add-on for DBC
A custom Race add-on for DBC 1.4.68 or 1.4.70.

This add-on was created by me (Hedaox). This is a very complex but incomplete add-on for adding new races in the DBC mod made by Jinryuu (Now the mod is developped by his brother Ben). Here his website : http://main.jingames.net/.

Here a video showing the custom race, for the moment only one, the bio-android ( Cell's Race ): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x035Gr2UDwM

I stopped programming the mod for personals reasons, and I do not wish to continue coding the mod. If you want to continue the mod please respect the open-source licensing and I will be pleased to help you if you have any questions. Contact me with discord at Hedaox#0074. You can find me on the official DBC discord (https://discord.gg/wfGu2xa) or some others discords made by the DBC community.

# <!>BEWARE: THE ADD-ON IS INCOMPLETE AND BUGGY AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN A PUBLIC DBC SERVER, A LOT OF CRASHES CAN OCCUR<!>

I advise using the add-on in single player or with friends, just for fun or for Role-Playing Scene. Again this add-on is in a proof of concept state and should not be used, as of right now, in public servers.

There is others races that are also hard coded (Buu race and Zen-oh Race), but no model or nothing have been made for them (that's why they appear dark), do not use them as they are highly buggy.
