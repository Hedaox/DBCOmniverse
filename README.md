# Omni Kings - Custom Race mod for DBC

A custom Race mod for DBC 1.4.68 or 1.4.70.

This mod was created by me (Hedaox). This is a very complex but incomplete mod for adding new races in the DBC mod made by Jinryuu (Now the mod is developped by his brother Ben). Here his website : http://main.jingames.net/.

Here a video showing the custom race, for the moment only one, the bio-android ( Cell's Race ): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x035Gr2UDwM

# <!>BEWARE: THE MOD IS INCOMPLETE AND BUGGY AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN A PUBLIC DBC SERVER, A LOT OF CRASHES CAN OCCUR<!>

I advise using the mod in single player or with friends, just for fun or for RP Scene. Again this mod is in a proof of concept state and should not be used as of right now. 

I stopped programming the mod for personals reasons, and I do not wish to continue coding the mod. If you want to continue the mod please respect the open-source licensing and I will be pleased to help you if you have any questions. Contact me with discord at Hedaox#0074. You can find me on the official DBC discord (https://discord.gg/wfGu2xa) or some others discords made by the DBC community.
